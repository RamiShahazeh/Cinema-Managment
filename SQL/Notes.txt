We tried to make the database a DDL file but it changed the table names to CINEMA.tablename so the SQL is in a seperate txt files.
first run the "DataBase.txt"
second run the "seq and tri for ID.txt" (one by one)
third run the "Database use pro and tri.txt"(one by one)
forth run the "insert procedures.txt"(one by one)
last but least run the "Admin Insertion.txt"
too work with the c# interfaces when you create new use you should put:
service name : cinema
username : cinema
